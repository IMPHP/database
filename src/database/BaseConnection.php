     * A driver class can extend this and add it's own specific scheme to the SQL
     * being parsed.
     *
     * You can optionally supply an array that will be populated with the original placeholder info.
     * This can be used internally by `enquire()` and `execute()` to ensure
     * that the correct data is added for each placeholder.
     *
     * __MySQL Example__
     * `QUERY WHERE column=%s` will be rewritten as `QUERY WHERE column=?`
     *
     * @note
     *      Do NOT parse SQL via this method BEFORE passing it to a method such as `execute()`
     *      or `enquire()`. This method is already used internally by these methods, which rely on
     *      library version of placeholders to do their work properly. 
     *
     * @param $sql
     *      The SQL string including formatting
     *
     * @param $params
     *      Optional array that will be populated with the original placeholder info
     *

     * This method will replace all the placeholder with the values from
     * `$values`. While doing so, data will be converted into appropriate types and
     * `string` values will be excaped by the `escape()` method.
     *
     * __Placeholders__:
     *
     * | Chars | Type    |
     * | :---- | :------ |
     * | %s    | string  |
     * | %i    | integer |

     * @note

     *      the output SQL for something else.
